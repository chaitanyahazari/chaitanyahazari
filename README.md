# Chaitanya Hazari

Senior Java developer focused on building reliable enterprise systems, clean architectures, and pragmatic developer-friendly solutions.

I care about code that is easy to reason about, safe to change, and stable in production.

## What I do
I build and maintain large-scale business applications with complex data models, strict audit requirements, and real-world constraints. I focus on:

- Backend services and APIs
- Data modeling and migrations
- Performance, stability, and observability
- Practical patterns that keep teams fast without creating long-term mess

## Current interests
I’m actively working on building **enterprise-grade agentic AI systems** with a strong emphasis on security, governance, and predictable behavior.

Areas I spend time on:
- Agent orchestration and tool-based workflows
- Structured-data-first AI systems
- Document + SQL hybrid architectures
- Production-safe evaluation and monitoring
- Responsible automation for business processes

## AI + agentic systems stack
I build agentic systems using a mix of Java and modern scripting ecosystems:

**Java / Spring**
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring AI
- JPA/Hibernate
- Maven

**Python**
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- LangGraph-style agent orchestration patterns
- Retrieval + evaluation pipelines

**Node.js**
- TypeScript
- Express
- NestJS-style modular service patterns
- Integration and workflow services

**Data + retrieval**
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server
- Vector and hybrid search patterns where appropriate
- Governance-first knowledge workflows

## Testing and automation
- JUnit
- Integration testing patterns
- Playwright (stability-first framework design)

## Platform and delivery
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud-hosted services and managed databases
- Observability-first design with logs, metrics, and traces

## Engineering style
I tend to value:

- Strong separation of concerns
- Consistent patterns across the codebase
- Small, readable abstractions over clever ones
- Defensive programming where it prevents real incidents
- Good defaults: formatting, tests, and predictable builds

## Selected work
A lot of my work involves large enterprise systems with strict governance and complex domain logic. I’m careful about what I publish publicly, but the themes you’ll see across my projects are:

- Clean service boundaries
- Thoughtful entity modeling and data access patterns
- Auditability and traceability
- Failure-safe workflows
- Practical performance improvements

Check the repos pinned on my profile for the best examples.

## Open source and experiments
This is where I explore:

- Reference implementations
- Architecture prototypes
- Utility libraries
- Testing templates
- Agent and integration patterns that translate well into enterprise settings

## What you can expect from my repos
Most repos aim to be:

- Easy to run
- Well documented
- Built with maintainable patterns
- Useful as a reference even if you don’t use the exact stack

## Community projects worth checking out
These are not my repos, but they’re excellent references:

- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai  
  A strong reference for building AI features in the Spring ecosystem.

- https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph  
  A practical blueprint for stateful agent workflows and tool orchestration.

- https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain  
  Useful patterns for retrieval, tools, and production-minded LLM integration.

- https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi  
  Clean examples of modern Python service design and API ergonomics.

- https://github.com/nestjs/nest  
  A solid reference for structured, scalable Node.js/TypeScript services.

- https://github.com/microsoft/playwright  
  Excellent for building reliable UI automation with a modern testing philosophy.
